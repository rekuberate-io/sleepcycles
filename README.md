Define sleep & wake up cycles for your Kubernetes resources. Automatically schedule to shutdown **Deployments**, **CronJobs**, 
**StatefulSets** and **HorizontalPodAutoscalers** that occupy resources in your cluster and wake them up **only** when you need them; 
in that way you can: 

- _schedule_ resource-hungry workloads (migrations, synchronizations, replications) in hours that do not impact your daily business
- _depressurize_ your cluster
- _decrease_ your costs
- _reduce_ your power consumption
- _lower_ you carbon footprint

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [K3D](https://k3d.io) to get a local cluster for testing, 
or run against a remote cluster. 

### Samples

Under `config/samples` you will find a set manifests that you can use to test this sleepcycles on your cluster:

#### SleepCycles

* _core_v1alpha1_sleepcycle_app_x.yaml_, manifests to deploy 2 `SleepCycle` resources in namespaces `app-1` and `app-2`

```yaml
apiVersion: core.rekuberate.io/v1alpha1
kind: SleepCycle
metadata:
  name: sleepcycle-app-1
  namespace: app-1
spec:
  shutdown: "1/2 * * * *"
  shutdownTimeZone: "Europe/Athens"
  wakeup: "*/2 * * * *"
  wakeupTimeZone: "Europe/Dublin"
  enabled: true
```

> [!NOTE]
> The cron expressions of the samples are tailored so you perform a quick demo. The `shutdown` expression schedules
> the deployment to scale down on _odd_ minutes and the `wakeup` schedule to scale up on _even_ minutes.

Every `SleepCycle` has the following **mandatory** properties:

- `shutdown`: cron expression for your shutdown schedule
- `enabled`: whether this sleepcycle policy is enabled

and the following **non-mandatory** properties:

- `shutdownTimeZone`: the timezone for your shutdown schedule, defaults to `UTC`
- `wakeup`: cron expression for your wake-up schedule
- `wakeupTimeZone`: the timezone for your wake-up schedule, defaults to `UTC`
- `successfulJobsHistoryLimit`: how many _completed_ CronJob Runner Pods to retain for debugging reasons, defaults to `1`
- `failedJobsHistoryLimit`: how many _failed_ CronJob Runner Pods to retain for debugging reasons, defaults to `1`
- `runnerImage`: the image to use when spawn CronJob Runner pods, defaults to `akyriako78/rekuberate-io-sleepcycles-runners`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DO **NOT** ADD **seconds** or **timezone** information to you cron expressions.

#### Demo workloads

* _whoami-app-1_x-deployment.yaml_, manifests to deploy 2 `Deployment` that provisions _traefik/whoami_ in namespace `app-1` 
* _whoami-app-2_x-deployment.yaml_, manifests to deploy a `Deployment`that provisions _traefik/whoami_ in namespace `app-2`
* _apache-hpa.yaml_, manifest to deploy an `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for a PHP application in namespace `app-2`
* _nginx-statefulset.yaml_, manifest to deploy a `Statefulset`in namespace `app-2`
* _busybox-cronjob.yaml_, manifest to deploy a `Statefulset`in namespace `app-1`

`SleepCycle` is a namespace-scoped custom resource; the controller will monitor all the resources in that namespace that
are marked with a `Label` that has as key `rekuberate.io/sleepcycle:` and as value the `name` of the manifest you created:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-2
  namespace: app-2
  labels:
    app: app-2
    rekuberate.io/sleepcycle: sleepcycle-app-2
spec:
  replicas: 9
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-2
  template:
    metadata:
      name: app-2
      labels:
        app: app-2
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app-2
          image: traefik/whoami
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any workload in namespace `kube-system` marked with `rekuberate.io/sleepcycle` will be ignored by the controller **by design**.

## How it works

The diagram below describes how `rekuberate.io/sleepcycles` are dealing with scheduling a `Deployment`: 

1. The `sleepcycle-controller` **watches** periodically, every 1min, all the `SleepCycle` custom resources for changes (in **all** namespaces).
2. The controller, for **every** `SleepCycle` resource within the namespace `app-1`, collects all the resources that have been marked with the label `rekuberate.io/sleepcycle: sleepcycle-app1`.
3. It provisions, for **every** workload - in this case deployment `deployment-app1` a `CronJob` for the shutdown schedule and optionally a second `CronJob` if a wake-up schedule is provided.
4. It provisions a `ServiceAccount`, a `Role` and a `RoleBinding` **per namespace**, in order to make possible for runner-pods to update resources' specs.
5. The `Runner` pods will be created automatically by the cron jobs and are responsible for scaling the resources up or down.

> [!NOTE]
> In the diagram it was depicted how `rekuberate.io/sleepcycles` scales `Deployment`. The same steps count for a
> `StatefulSet` and a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`. There are two exception though:
> - a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` will scale down to `1` replica and not to `0` as for a `Deployment` or a `Statefulset`.
> - a `CronJob` has no replicas to scale up or down, it is going to be enabled or suspended respectively.

### Using it together with ArgoCD

You can combine `rekuberate.io/sleepcycles` with applications provisioned with [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), 
**as long as** you disable [self-healing](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/#automatic-self-healing) 
when an automatic sync policy is enabled, otherwise ArgoCD's sync mechanism will operate antagonistically towards the 
shutdown and wakeup cronjobs. In this case ArgoCD will always automatically revert to the state described in the 
git manifests and practically will cancel the effect of the sleepcycle schedule. An ArgoCD application with Manual or 
Automatic sync policy **without** self-healing will work as expected.

> [!TIP]
> There is a git repository in place, with all the necessary artifacts to deploy via ArgoCD 
> an nginx application and a preconfigured sleepcycle. You can find the git repo [here](https://github.com/rekuberate-io/argocd-guide). 

## Deploy

### From sources

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG` in `Makefile`:

```shell
# Image URL to use all building/pushing image targets
DOCKER_HUB_NAME ?= $(shell docker info | sed '/Username:/!d;s/.* //')
# sleepcycles
IMG_TAG ?= $(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD)
IMG_NAME ?= rekuberate-io-sleepcycles
IMG ?= $(DOCKER_HUB_NAME)/$(IMG_NAME):$(IMG_TAG)
# runners
RUNNERS_IMG_NAME ?= rekuberate-io-sleepcycles-runners
RUNNERS_IMG ?= $(DOCKER_HUB_NAME)/$(RUNNERS_IMG_NAME)
# targets
PLATFORMS ?= linux/arm64,linux/amd64,linux/s390x,linux/ppc64le
# CONTAINER_TOOL defines the container tool to be used for building images.
# Be aware that the target commands are only tested with Docker which is
# scaffolded by default. However, you might want to replace it to use other
# tools. (i.e. podman)
CONTAINER_TOOL ?= docker
```

```sh
make docker-buildx
```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster using the image defined in `IMG`:

```sh
make install && make deploy
```

and then deploy the samples:

```sh
kubectl create namespace app-1
kubectl create namespace app-2
kubectl apply -f config/samples
```

#### Uninstall

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Using Helm (from sources)

If you are on a development environment, you can quickly test & deploy the controller to the cluster
using a **Helm chart** directly from `config/helm`:

```sh
helm install rekuberate-io-sleepcycles config/helm/ -n <namespace> --create-namespace
```

and then deploy the samples:

```sh
kubectl create namespace app-1
kubectl create namespace app-2
kubectl apply -f config/samples
```
#### Uninstall

```shell
helm uninstall rekuberate-io-sleepcycles -n <namespace>
```

### Using Helm (from repo)

On the other hand if you are deploying on a production environment, it is **highly recommended** to deploy the 
controller to the cluster using a **Helm chart** from its repo:


```sh
helm repo add sleepcycles https://rekuberate-io.github.io/sleepcycles/
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install sleepcycles sleepcycles/sleepcycles -n rekuberate-system --create-namespace
```

and then deploy the samples:

```sh
kubectl create namespace app-1
kubectl create namespace app-2
kubectl apply -f config/samples
```
#### Uninstall

```shell
helm uninstall rekuberate-io-sleepcycles -n <namespace>
```

## Develop

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Controller

#### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make generate
make manifests
```

then install the CRDs in the cluster with:

```sh
make install
```

> [!TIP]
> You can debug the controller in the IDE of your choice by hooking to the `main.go` **or** you can start
> the controller _without_ debugging with:

```sh
make run
```

> [!TIP]
> Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets 
> More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

#### Build

You always need to build a new docker container and push it to your repository:

```sh
make docker-buildx 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this case you will need to adjust your Helm chart values to use your repository and container image.

### Runner

#### Build

Adjust the image and container registry name in `Makefile`:

```shell
# runners
RUNNERS_IMG_NAME ?= rekuberate-io-sleepcycles-runners
RUNNERS_IMG ?= $(DOCKER_HUB_NAME)/$(RUNNERS_IMG_NAME)
```

and then build and push the new image to the registry:

```sh
make docker-buildx-runner
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this case you will need to adjust the `runnerImage` of your `SleepCycle` manifest to use your own Runner image,
> otherwise it defaults always to `akyriako78/rekuberate-io-sleepcycles-runners`

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```
